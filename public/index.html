        <h1>What is Disc Golf?</h1>
        <h5>
            Disc golf is a dynamic and engaging sport that combines elements of traditional 
            golf with the thrill of frisbee throwing. Players traverse through a course, aiming 
            to land their specialized disc in a series of baskets, strategically placed amidst 
            trees, shrubs, and varying terrain. The objective mirrors that of traditional golf: 
            to complete each hole in the fewest number of throws.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            The game typically consists of 9 or 18 holes, each with its unique layout and challenges. 
            Just like in traditional golf, courses can vary in difficulty, offering players of all skill 
            levels an opportunity to enjoy the game. Disc golf is accessible to people of all ages and 
            fitness levels, making it a popular choice for families, friends, and individuals alike.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Disc golf discs come in different shapes and sizes, each designed for specific throwing techniques 
            and distances. Players utilize a variety of throws, including backhand, forehand, and overhead, to 
            navigate obstacles and control the flight of the disc. Precision, technique, and strategy are essential 
            elements of the game, as players must adapt to changing wind conditions and terrain.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            One of the most appealing aspects of disc golf is its emphasis on outdoor recreation and camaraderie.
             Players enjoy spending time in nature, exploring scenic courses, and challenging themselves to improve 
             their skills. Whether played competitively or casually, disc golf fosters a sense of community and sportsmanship 
             among participants, making it a beloved pastime enjoyed by millions around the world.

        <h1>Our Courses</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>Covered Bridge Park:</h3>
            <h5>
                Moderately hilly and heavily wooded. This course was designed by a local Boy Scout 
                as an Eagle project.  The course is a mix of short range skill shots with various 
                elevation changes.  This is an all par 3 course and is a great beginner course as well 
                as a great practice course for higher skill levels.
            </h5>

            <h3>South Mountain:</h3>
            <h5>
                Fun rugged mountain course in woods. Fun lines and challenging. Great on hot days due 
                to plenty of shade and elevation but watch your step as rocks make it easy to turn an 
                ankle or trip.
            </h5>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Hanover Community Center:</h3>
            <h5>
                A great open beginners course, that now features a back 9 that uses the same holes as 
                the front 9 but with different tee layouts. Only a few holes need a different shot approach
                 with obstacles while most are straight and open. 
            </h5>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Moore Township:</h3>
            <h5>
                Good practice course with a variety of short shot shaping holes and longer open holes. 
                The first few holes have very fun lines, and the wooded holes are generally short, but 
                tight and require some technical precision. The two par 4 holes are very open, but long.
            </h5>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Camp Olympic Park:</h3>
            <h5>
                Tight lines mixed with a little distance, great course for a small challenge and a fun time. 
                Very well maintained. Elevation and water are used to vary the shots and holes.
